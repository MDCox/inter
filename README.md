inter
===========

Extremely minimal lib that lets you interact directly with a page

Implements common js functions without having to rely on a large library like jQuery or an even larger framework.
Designed so you can easily remove pieces that you do not use to further minimize lib size.

If you use this library and happen to run into someone who has contributed to it, strongly consider buying them a beer/coffee/social beverage to say thank you.  Other than that, do what you will.
